<h1><u>About me</u></h1>
<p>My name is Angelo Ponniah, and I am currently enrolled as a sophmore in Verrazzano Honors Program at College Of Staten Island, 
    where I am pursuing a Double major in Information systems and Communications. This academic pipeline will guide me into the intricate 
    world of IT. I take pride in what I do in my classes and I get to meet new people everyday to help me engage and be productive.</p>

  <p>Want to Know what I really be doing other than school? Well I work two part time jobs. One at a deli, where I am a deli clerk and the 
    other one from home, working as CRM specialist for a company called nexxon media. I truly do enjoy what I do for work. I also do have 
    something fun that I do everyday, which is Working Out. In addition to that I play Soccer and basketball once every week. You might be
    wondering how I have time for all these... All I gotta tell yall is that I'm HIM.
</p>  

<p> Yall thought that's all I had to say... womp womp there is more... I tell myself everyday when I wake up "Life is a gamble",
    I say that cause I am a day trader by day and i'm a ELITE gambler by night when it comes to sports betting LOL. I stand on business when 
    it's  really time to stand on business but I really want yall be able to fight through any challenges and really think about it and make a 
    decision. Rock on Peeps!!!
